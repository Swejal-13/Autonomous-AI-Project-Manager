Project: {project_title}
Context: {project_description}
Expertise Level: {experience_required} years
Current Status: PROJECT IS OVERDUE (Original Deadline Missed).

Your goal is to create a RECOVERY PLAN to minimize damage and complete the project as fast as possible.

CRITICAL RECOVERY RULES:
1. **PRIORITIZE CRITICAL PATH**: Focus ONLY on tasks essential for MVP/Release. Cut nice-to-haves.
2. **AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULING**: Tasks should be broken down for maximum parallelization.
3. **DAMAGE CONTROL**: Identify the most critical failing components first.
4. **NEW TIMELINE**: You must estimate a realistic recovery timeline (e.g. 5 days, 10 days).

For each task, provide:
1. Title: Action-oriented recovery task (e.g. "Hotfix: Database Schema", "Critical: Auth Service").
2. Description: Specific recovery steps.
3. Estimated Hours: Optimistic but realistic.
4. Required Skills: Technologies needed.
5. Priority: MUST be 'critical' or 'high'.
6. Deadline: Relative from NOW (e.g. "Day 1 (Recovery)", "Day 3 (Recovery)").

Project Duration: {days_remaining} days remaining until final deadline.

Your goal is to decompose this project into EXACTLY 10 technical tasks that follow a logical implementation sequence.

CRITICAL LOGIC RULES:
1. **SEQUENTIAL DEPENDENCY**: You cannot deploy what isn't built. Infrastructure and Core Features MUST come before 'Final Deployment' or 'Production Setup'.
2. **PHASED APPROACH**: 
   - Early: Database Schema, Auth, Core API.
   - Middle: Frontend UI, Business Logic, Integration.
   - Late: Testing, DevOps, Production Deployment.
3. **REALISTIC DEADLINES**: Assign a `deadline` that MUST be within the {days_remaining} day project window.
   - Use formats like 'Day 1-2', 'Day 3', 'Day {days_remaining}'.
   - NO task deadline can exceed Day {days_remaining}.
4. **TIME PRESSURE**: If days remaining is low (e.g. 3-5 days), tasks must be more aggressive and focused on MVP.

Categories to cover:
- Frontend UI
- Authentication/Security
- Backend API & Logic
- Database Architecture
- DevOps/Infrastructure

For each task, provide:
1. Title: Unique and specific.
2. Description: Deep technical implementation details.
3. Estimated Hours: Realistic engineering effort.
4. Required Skills: Specific technologies needed.
5. Priority: Based on path-to-launch importance.
6. Deadline: Relative timing in the project lifecycle (MUST be within Day 1 to Day {days_remaining}).
